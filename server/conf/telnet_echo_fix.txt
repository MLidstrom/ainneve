TELNET ECHO FIX APPLIED TO AINNEVE
===================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
Ainneve (like base Evennia) wasn't sending the "IAC WILL ECHO" command during telnet negotiation.
This caused telnet clients to not see what they were typing.

BEFORE FIX:
- Server sent various telnet options but not ECHO
- Client kept local echo on (characters not visible when typing)

AFTER FIX:
- Server now sends "IAC WILL 1 (ECHO)" during connection
- This tells the client that the server will handle echoing
- Client should turn off local echo and let server echo back characters

SOLUTION APPLIED:
- Created custom TelnetProtocol in server/conf/fix_telnet_echo.py
- Added TELNET_PROTOCOL_CLASS setting to use the custom protocol
- Custom protocol forces sending "IAC WILL ECHO" on connection

CHANGES MADE:
1. Created: server/conf/fix_telnet_echo.py
2. Modified: server/conf/settings.py
   - Added: TELNET_PROTOCOL_CLASS = "server.conf.fix_telnet_echo.TelnetProtocol"

TESTING:
After restarting the Ainneve server, telnet connections should now properly display
what you type when connecting via telnet to localhost:4000.

The telnet echo bug has been fixed. You should now be able to see what you 
type when connecting via telnet to your Ainneve game.
